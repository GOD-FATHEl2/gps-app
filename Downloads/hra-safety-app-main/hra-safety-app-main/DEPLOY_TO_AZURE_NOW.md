---

## 🚀 Quick Deployment Guide

### Option 1: Full GitHub + Azure Automation (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click "+" → "New repository"
3. Name: `hra-safety-app`
4. Description: `HRA Safety Management System for Volvo Cars`
5. Make it **Public**
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we have everything ready)
7. Click "Create repository"

#### Step 2: Push to GitHub
```powershell
# Run these commands in your PowerShell (in the project directory)
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hra-safety-app.git
git push -u origin main
```
*Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username*

#### Step 3: Configure GitHub Secrets
Go to your repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions

Add these secrets:
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: `eb9865fe-5d08-43ed-8ee9-6cad32b74981`
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`: `81fa766e-a349-4867-8bf4-ab35e250a08f`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Azure App secret
- `JWT_SECRET`: Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`

#### Step 4: Azure Setup
```bash
az login
az group create --name rg-hra-safety --location "West Europe"
az containerapp env create --name env-hra-safety --resource-group rg-hra-safety --location "West Europe"
```

#### Step 5: Automatic Deployment
- Any push to `main` branch triggers automatic deployment!
- GitHub Actions builds Docker image and deploys to Azure Container Apps
- Check the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repo to monitor progress

---

### Option 2: Manual Azure Deployment (Quick Start)

If you want to deploy immediately without GitHub Actions:

```powershell
# Run the PowerShell deployment script
.\deploy-azure.ps1 -GitHubUsername "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME"
```

This will:
- Create Azure resources
- Build and push Docker image
- Deploy to Container Apps
- Test the deployment

---

## 🌐 Expected Results

After deployment, your app will be available at:
- **Main App**: `https://hra-safety-app.azurecontainerapps.io`
- **Health Check**: `https://hra-safety-app.azurecontainerapps.io/health`

**Features that will work immediately:**
✅ MSAL Azure AD authentication for Volvo Cars users  
✅ Complete form submission with image upload  
✅ Health monitoring and auto-scaling  
✅ Production-ready security and performance  

---

## 🔧 Final Configuration

After deployment, update your Azure AD app:
1. Azure Portal → App registrations → your app
2. Authentication → Add redirect URI: `https://hra-safety-app.azurecontainerapps.io`
3. Save

---

## 📊 Monitoring

Once deployed, you can monitor:
- **Azure Portal**: Container Apps metrics and logs
- **GitHub Actions**: Deployment history and status
- **Health Endpoint**: Real-time application status
