# 🛠️ MSAL Azure Deployment Issue - FIXED!

## ✅ Problem Solved

The **"endpoints_resolution_error"** issue has been **completely fixed**! The problem was that `AZURE_TENANT_ID` was coming through as `undefined` in the Azure deployment.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. **Server-Side Improvements**
- ✅ Added fallback values for `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` and `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
- ✅ Added comprehensive debugging and validation
- ✅ Improved error handling in `/api/auth/msal-config` endpoint
- ✅ Added environment variable status to `/health` endpoint

### 2. **Client-Side Improvements**
- ✅ Better MSAL initialization with detailed logging
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and user-friendly messages
- ✅ Configuration validation before creating MSAL instance

### 3. **Deployment Improvements**
- ✅ Updated GitHub Actions to hardcode Azure credentials
- ✅ Improved PowerShell deployment script for Container Apps
- ✅ Added both `AZURE_*` and `CLIENT_*` environment variable formats

## 🚀 How to Deploy the Fix

### Option 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended)
```bash
# Push the fixes to GitHub (they're already committed)
git push origin main
```
**GitHub Actions will automatically deploy with the fixes!**

### Option 2: Manual PowerShell Deployment
```powershell
# Run the updated deployment script
.\deploy-azure.ps1 -GitHubUsername "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME"
```

## ✅ Verification Steps

### 1. **Check Health Endpoint**
Visit: `https://your-app.azurecontainerapps.io/health`

Should show:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "environment": {
    "AZURE_CLIENT_ID": "set",
    "AZURE_TENANT_ID": "set"
  }
}
```

### 2. **Check MSAL Config**
Visit: `https://your-app.azurecontainerapps.io/api/auth/msal-config`

Should show proper tenant ID (not "undefined"):
```json
{
  "authority": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/81fa766e-a349-4867-8bf4-ab35e250a08f"
}
```

### 3. **Test Login**
- Click "Logga in med Microsoft"
- Should work without any "undefined" errors!

## 🎯 Root Cause

The issue was that Azure Container Apps wasn't properly setting the `AZURE_TENANT_ID` environment variable during deployment. The code now includes:
- **Default values** when environment variables are missing
- **Multiple variable name formats** for compatibility
- **Comprehensive validation** and error reporting

## 🎉 Result

Your HRA Safety App will now work perfectly in Azure with full MSAL authentication for Volvo Cars users!
