# GPS Tracking System Requirements
# Created by Eng. Nawoar Ekkou & Walace Cagnin

# No external dependencies required for the enhanced GPS tracking system
# The system uses only Python standard library modules:
# - http.server (for web server)
# - socketserver (for TCP server)
# - json (for JSON handling)
# - threading (for background movement simulation)
# - math (for coordinate calculations)
# - random (for realistic movement variation)
# - datetime (for timestamps)
# - time (for delays and timing)
# - os (for file operations)
# - urllib.parse (for URL parsing)

# If you want to add additional features in the future, uncomment these:
# requests>=2.31.0          # For external API calls
# flask>=2.3.0              # Alternative web framework
# gunicorn>=21.2.0          # Production WSGI server
# numpy>=1.24.0             # Advanced mathematical operations
# pandas>=2.0.0             # Data analysis for GPS logs
